# Genesis Wallet Demo  
An interactive mockup of the Genesis Wallet user interface built as a static site for GitHub Pages. It simulates a cryptocurrency portfolio with sample token balances and provides modal interactions for receiving, sending and swapping tokens. The demo is powered by the T Gen AI engine.  

## Features  
- Display of portfolio balance and sample tokens (Solana, USD Coin and Raydium) with amounts.  
- Clicking a token opens a modal with actions: Receive, Send and Swap, accompanied by sound effects.  
- The Receive action shows a dummy receiving address and QR code.  
- The Send and Swap actions present input fields for recipient addresses and amounts and a confirm button that triggers a simulated transaction confirmation.  
- Responsive and stylized UI with a radial gradient background, neon colours and subtle animations.  

## Project Structure  
- **index.html** – contains the main markup for the wallet interface, token list, modal and footer disclaimer.  
- **script.js** – implements JavaScript logic for UI interactions, audio playback, modal management and simulated transactions.  
- **style.css** – defines fonts, layout, token cards, modal styling, buttons and animations.  
- **genesis-logo.png** – the wallet logo image.  

## Usage  
Clone the repository and open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Click on a token card to open the modal and interact with the available wallet actions. The demo uses static dummy data and does not perform real blockchain transactions.  

## Disclaimer  
This is a demonstration environment. The UI and token data are simulated for demonstration purposes and may not reflect final production features. Use it purely for previewing the Genesis Wallet interface.  

## Deployment  
The project requires no build steps and can be deployed via GitHub Pages or any static hosting service. Simply serve the files in the repository.  

## Architecture  
Genesis Wallet uses a layered architecture connecting the Solana execution layer with an AI‑driven intelligence mesh. Each subsystem communicates through zero‑knowledge relays to preserve privacy and maintain real‑time performance. The main components are:  
- **Solana Network** – base execution environment for high‑throughput smart‑contract interactions.  
- **T‑Gen AI Layer** – distributed inference network for adaptive defense and behavioural prediction.  
- **User Node** – operator identity layer authenticated and learned by T‑Gen.  
- **Execution Layer** – processes Solana instructions, manages RPC routing and ensures deterministic confirmation speed.  
- **AI Defense Mesh** – detects and isolates anomalies through decentralized inference nodes powered by T‑Gen AI.  
- **Autonomous Control Layer** – maintains wallet states, executes adaptive recovery and synchronizes key‑state consensus.  

## Future Enhancements  
To evolve the Genesis Wallet beyond this demo, incorporate emerging cryptocurrency wallet technologies:  
- **Account abstraction smart accounts** – programmable smart accounts that can schedule automatic payments, bundle multiple transactions and support social recovery.  
- **Multi‑Party Computation (MPC) key management** – split private keys into encrypted shares across multiple parties for joint signing and distributed key generation.  
- **AI‑powered personalization** – use AI for predictive analytics, personalized insights and automated investment management.  
- **Biometric security** – integrate fingerprint, facial recognition or behavioural biometrics for strong user authentication.  
- **Cross‑chain interoperability** – support assets on multiple blockchains to enable seamless swaps and aggregated portfolio management.  
- **Decentralized identity integration** – store and manage digital identity documents within the wallet to support Web3 identification.  
- **Metaverse and NFT readiness** – manage NFTs and virtual assets across metaverse platforms and Web3 applications.  
- **Eco‑friendly features** – track carbon footprints of transactions and incentivize sustainable behaviour.  
- **Social recovery and inheritance** – implement social recovery and digital asset inheritance mechanisms to ensure account continuity.  
- **Zero‑knowledge proofs** – use zero‑knowledge cryptography to verify transactions and user information without revealing sensitive data.
